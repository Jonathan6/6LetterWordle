## Overview

This project was designed to enhance React state management, improve component-based UI design, and integrate efficient build tooling with Vite. The game logic follows the Wordle formula, where players guess a six-letter word and receive color-coded feedback based on letter correctness and positioning.


## Features

âœ… Dynamic Game Board: A responsive UI that displays user input, validates guesses, and provides feedback.
âœ… Keyboard Input Handling: Users can type guesses using an on-screen or physical keyboard.
âœ… State Management: React hooks (useState) manage user input, game logic, and UI updates.
âœ… Fast Build and Hot Reloading: Uses Vite for quick development cycles.
âœ… Optimized Performance: Minimal re-renders and efficient state updates.


## Technologies Used

### [React](https://react.dev/)

- Component-based architecture: The application is built using reusable components, making it scalable and maintainable.
- State management: useState and useEffect hooks manage game progress, user input, and UI updates.

### [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

- Fast development server: Provides near-instant hot module replacement (HMR).
Optimized builds: Faster than traditional bundlers like Webpack.

### [Recharts.js](https://recharts.org/en-US)

- Data visualization: Used to display statistics such as win rates and guess distribution.
